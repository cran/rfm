## Overview

Tools for customer segmentation using RFM (recency, frequency and
monetary) analysis.

## Installation

``` r
# Install rfm from CRAN
install.packages("rfm")

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rsquaredacademy/rfm")
```

## Usage

**RFM** (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a behavior based
technique used to segment customers by examining their transaction
history such as:

- how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
- how often they purchase (frequency)
- how much the customer spends (monetary)

It is based on the marketing axiom that **80% of your business comes
from 20% of your customers**. RFM analysis helps to identify customers
who are more likely to respond to promotions by segmenting them into
various categories.

To calculate the RFM score we need the following info for each customer:

- a unique customer id
- date of transaction/order
- transaction/order amount

``` r
# analysis date
analysis_date <- as.Date('2006-12-31')

# generate rfm score
rfm_result <- rfm_table_order(rfm_data_orders, customer_id, order_date,
revenue, analysis_date)

# rfm score
rfm_result
#> # A tibble: 995 x 11
#>   customer_id    recency_days transaction_count amount recency_score
